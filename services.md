# Services

A `Service` is a `ReActor` with some already implemented behaviors that allow to easily publish a functionality.
This means that a publishing a `Service`, it will be automatically published on all the registered [service registries](channel_drivers/README.md), 
it will be automatically made [discoverable](#Service Discovery), [searchable](#Service Filtering), [updated](#Service Statistics) and [vertically scalable](#Routers).
Elastic horizontal scalability is planned, but not yet implemented.
