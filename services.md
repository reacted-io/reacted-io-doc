# Services

A `Service` is a `ReActor` with some already implemented behaviors that allow to easily publish a functionality in a cluster.
This means that a publishing a `Service` on a [service registry](channel_drivers/README.md), it will be immediately and 
automatically [discoverable](#Service Discovery), [searchable](#Service Filtering), [updated](#Service Statistics) and [vertically scalable](#Routers).
Automatic horizontal scalability is planned, but not yet implemented.
