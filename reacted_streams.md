# ReActed Streams

A *reacted stream* is a *distributed*, *multi subscriber* and message stream with customizable automatic backpressure
out of the box. A *reacted stream publisher* is a `Serializable` entity, this means that the publisher can flow within
a reacted cluster and any interested reactor can simply subscribe to it to start receiving its data.
